## Understanding The Context

As a Data Scientist, you are required to create a model that will allow Koppokoppo to provide a solution is able to predict whether a loan offered to the certain small and medium enterprise will be paid off.

#### Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Summary Of Findings
* The ensemble learning classifiers and the decision tree classifier returned 100% accuracy scores with no false positives or false negatives.

## Recommendations / Conclusions
While these are great scores, I would recommend that the decision makers at Koppokoppo exercise caution while using these methods due to overfitting. Just because the models were perfectly accurate with this data does not mean the same will happen with different data.

## Challenging your Solution
* Meeting the assumptions of the algorithms (e.g., no multicollinearity, normality, etc. for logistic regression)

* Performing hyperparameter tuning.

* Feature selection - discarding the features considered unnecessary or unimportant.

* Cross Validation
